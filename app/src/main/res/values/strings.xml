    <string name="temp_item_text_string">philosopher John Stuart Mill. As he saw it, society is mistaken to set up an ethical double standard according to which women\'s morality is to be assessed differently than men\'s morality. Reflecting on women\'s alleged moral superiority, Mill concluded that women\'s morality is simply the result of systematic social conditioning. To laud women on account of their “complex abnegation of themselves,” (J.S. Mill, The Subjection of Women, p. 32) is merely to compliment society for inculcating in women those psychological traits that serve to maintain it. Women are taught to live for others; to always give and never take; to submit, yield and obey; to be long-suffering. They are also taught to demur to men because they are not as smart and strong as men. This being the case, women\'s virtue is not the product of autonomous choice. Rather, it is the consequence of social programming. At root, there is but one virtue—human virtue—and women as well as men should be pushed to adhere to its standards. Then, and only then, will society be as just and prosperous as possible. (J.S. Mill, The Subjection of Women, 1970). philosopher John Stuart Mill.
